The problems we were solving for projects in this course was the generation and accessibility of organized data. This consisted of designing a program that would generate and print course schedule and information for the academic advisors in the computer science department at ABCU.

Any problems I encountered I researched to garner clarity to surmounting the obstacle I faced. Data structures are important to understand due to the structures being a part of algorithms that help us manage data more proficient and economically.

The way I overcame any roadblocks was by utilizing the tutoring system the school offered. 

The work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and programs by ushering me to question how I elucidate and construe program design. The alogorithms were poignant in my understanding on how to approach program production. 

The work on this project contributed to the evolution of the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by causing me to examine the details in more depth. It will cause me to study and practice modular programming more. Also, it made me realize the important of algorithms and data structures. And in the future, I will always seek a way to implement one, or the other, or both.
